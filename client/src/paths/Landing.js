                        I built this app as part of a portfolio project initally. But once I got it going,
                        with everything working together, I found it really useful for planning out my next 
                        steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I actually use this application every day as I work on things, and work to get things
                        out of my head, and written out.
                    </p>
